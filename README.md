## Summary  

The current repository provides an RStudio project directory containing scripts and data used for the analysis of microarray data reported in Milano et al. (2021).  

The raw Affymetrix microarray data are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) depository with accession number GSE115254.  


## Contents  
The repository includes 8 rmarkdown (.Rmd) scripts that generate the following manuscript figures and supporting data files:  

* Figure_1_A.pdf  
* Figure_1_B.pdf  
* Figure_1_CD.pdf  
* Figure_1_E.pdf  
* Figure_S1.pdf  
* Figure_S2.pdf  
* Supplemental_Data_1.xlsx  
* Supplemental_Data_2.xlsx  

Scripts must be run in the order as numbered because intermediate data files are generated that serve as input to later scripts.  

The rmarkdown scripts generate reports in [html notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html) (.nb.html) format that can be viewed in a web browser. Pre-compiled html notebooks that were generated during development are stored in the `html_notebooks` folder, and they include documentation on the versions of R and of R packages used (see sections entitled 'Session info').  

## Issues  
If you notice any problems with the analyses, please raise an issue on Github.
