## Summary  

The current repository provides an RStudio project directory containing scripts and data used for the analysis of microaray data reported in Milano et al. (2021).  

The raw Affymetrix data are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) depository with accession number GSE115254.  


## Contents  
The repository includes 8 rmarkdown (.Rmd) scripts that generate the following manuscript figures and supporting data files:  

* Figure_1_A.pdf  
* Figure_1_B.pdf  
* Figure_1_CD.pdf  
* Figure_1_E.pdf  
* Figure_S1.pdf  
* Figure_S2.pdf  
* Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx  
* Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx  

The rmarkdown scripts generate reports in [html notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html) (.nb.html) format that can be viewed in a web browser. Pre-compiled html notebooks generated during development are stored in the `html_notebooks` folder, and they include documentation on the versions of R and R packages used. Html notebooks files include the R code that was used to generate them; the code can be extracted from a dropdown menu in the top right corner of each file.
